## My very first project

I'll use this example to teach you markdown.  It is good  because:

- it creates lists automatically
- it has automatic headlines
- and that's it.

Today we'll create a program to analyze passwords. This means we need to figure out what a good password is:

1. We'll pass a password in the command line
2. We'll check many of these rules

- at least 8 characters
- at least one of them should be a special character (!@#$)
- at least one number
- at least one upper case
- should be unique
- should be memorable 

3. We'll print a report to see how good the password was
